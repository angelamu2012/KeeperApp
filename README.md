**Keeper App**

This is a Keeper notes app that is similar to Google Keep. To add a note, simply add text to the Title field and to the body of the note. Click the "Add" button to save the note. To delete a note, click the "Delete" button for a specific note. Notes must have both a title and a body to be saved. Closing or refreshing the page will not delete your saved notes.

This app uses React, node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
